make a functionto calculate square root :
	declar perfectSquare and n = 0 with data type int
	declare d ,  p ,  a , rootOfs with floot data type
	if the number givin from user is more than 0 :
		make a for loop in range of number to more than 0 decreasing 1 by 1 :
			make a nested for loop started from 1 till it equal to main for loop value and increasing 1 by 1 :
				if value of nested for loop square equal to value of main for loop value:
					perfectSquare = main for loop value
					n = nested for loop value
					then break the nested for loop
			if perfectSquare more than 0 then break the main loop
		d = num - perfectSquare
		p =d/(2.0*n)
		A = n+p
		rootOfs = a-((p*p)/(2.0*a))
		print the value of rootOfs in screen
	else if num equal to 0 then the print square root also 0
	else print no square root for this number
