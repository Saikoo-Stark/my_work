make a function to encrypt the message comming from from user:
	take message from user 
	take depth of encryption
	remove white spaces in message
	make an empty matrix with n rows = depth and columns = length of message 
	make a for loop to fill al matrix empty places with dots
	make a for loop that put all characters in message in zig-zag mode by:
		put a character in row = column 
		if row == last row then row = row - 1
		if row == first row the row = row +1
		til all characters in message would be done
	after finishing for loop
	make an empty string then put every character from the matrix expect dots
	print the encrypted message to user 
	
make a function to decrypt the message commin from user:
	take message from user 
	take depth of encryption
	remove white spaces in message
	make an empty matrix with n rows = depth and columns = length of message 
	make a for loop that put all characters in message in zig-zag mode by:
		put a character in row = column 
		if row == last row then row = row - 1
		if row == first row the row = row +1
		til all characters in message would be done
	after finishing this for loop , make another for loop to replace all character in matrix with every character in decrypted message
	make an empty string then put every character from the matrix expect dots
	print the decrypted message to user
	
make a function to run the programme:
	ask user whether he wants to (encrypt or decrypt) a message or exit from the programme
	repeat this function permmenentaly after every finished task expect exit task
