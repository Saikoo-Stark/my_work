importing all needed libs

make a map template called code to store key and value of all possiable characters 

make a function to sreach about a key by its value :
	make a for loop for every character in string givin to this function:
		convert character to string 
		make nested for loop to search in every key in a map :
			if key equal to the string :
				return that key
	return ""



make a function to encrypt text from user:
	make  a for loop for every char in string :
		search about this character in code map created above
		store every value searched above in a variable called encrypted with data type string
	return encrypted from this function
	
	

make a function to decrypt text from user:

	make  a for loop for every char in string :
		search about this character in code map created above
		store every value searched above in a variable called encrypted with data type string
	return encrypted from this function


make a function to run the code :
	print a hello message to user 
	ask him to encrypt or decrypt or exit from the programme
	if he wants to encrypt the text then run encrypt function after that reapeat this function again
	if he wants to decrypt an encrypted text run decrypt function after that reapeat this function again
	if he wants to exit then exit the programme
